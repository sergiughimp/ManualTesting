        1. Testing principles (rules)
            1. Testing shows presence of defects 
            2. Exhausive testing is impossible
            3. Early testing
            4. Defect Clustering
            5. Pesticide paradox
            6. Testing is context dependent
            7. Absence of errors fallacy
        2. Test levels:
